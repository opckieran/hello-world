# hello-world

Hello, I am new to GitHub and want to learn how to use it and learn how to program at the same time. My current interests include OpenStack, Python, Ruby, and Rust to name a few. Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and Artificial Intelligence are also of interest to me. I occasionally dabble in programming here and there, but I think it's time I started taking it seriously.
